<p><strong>HISTORY OF SACRED HEART OF JESUS  PARISH-  DAGORETTI</strong><br><br>
Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish - Dagoretti is located in the metropolitan city of Nairobi, covering parts of both Dagoretti South and Dagoretti North, from Jamhuri in the East to Gatina/Kawangware in the West. The parish is found within the Archdiocese of Nairobi, in the Western Deanery. Founded by Late Cardinal Maurice Otunga, the Servant of God, on 13th August, 1989, it is the amalgamation of 5 churches from 3 different parishes. Dagoretti Corner was under Guadalupe, Satelite-Kabiria was under St. John Riruta, Ngando was under St. Mary’s Karen, Gatia was under St. John Riruta and Dagoretti Market was again under St. John Riruta. 
Now the Parish is composed of St. Vincent Pallotti-Dagoretti Corner as the mother church and two other outsation churches. The other two churches are: Saint Francis of Assisi – Gatina which was an outstation of St. John the Baptist – Riruta and Sacred Heart churchf Jesus -Ngando which was an outstation of Regina Caeli Karen which was by then known as St. Mary’s. It was in 1993 that the Parish Pastoral Council sat and chose St. Vincent Pallotti – Dagoretti Corner to be the mother church and the center of administration. The Parish covers approximately 20 sq km. 
In the history of three decades, we have matured in faith, hope and charity. We have grown to be a faith community where love and unity is experienced, a community nourished by the celebration of the Holy Eucharist as we identify ourselves more closely with Christ and His mission to the world. We are proud on 27th July, 2007 to have  begotten another Parish, Mary Queen of Apostles – Dagoretti Market.
From its infancy, the Parish had a lot of individuals and congregations who came on board to assist and do their apostolate in the parish. We have Montfort Community, Patrician Brothers, Franciscan Sisters of Sacred Heart, Little Srs of St. Francis, Daughters of Sacred Heart, Srs of St. Joseph of Tarbes, Fransiscan Srs of St. Anne, Salesians brothers and sisters, Capuchins, Fransciscans of Hope, Mary Imaculate Srs, ODN Srs …etc, to mention a few.
