      <p>In 1983 the late Mama Grace Wahu Kenyatta gave the land on which the Church stand by now, after hearing that the leaders were looking for a plot to build a church. With the help of Mama Ngina Kenyatta and the Late Councilor a ‘harambee’ was done and soon the construction of the Church began being managed by Mr. Simon Macharia. On 13/8/1989 the Church was entrusted to the Parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus under the Congregation of Pallottine Fathers.
