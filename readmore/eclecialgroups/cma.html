        WHAT IS CMA?
    <h2>CATHOLIC MEN ASSOCIATION (CMA)</h2>
    <strong>CATHOLIC MEN ASSOCIATION (CMA)</strong> also known as Catholic Men Association is a is a lay non-profit making and non-political membership of baptized and devout male Christians of Roman Catholic Church. It brings together male members of the catholic church to evangelize in following the example of St. Joseph our Patron Saint. This practice is expected to be felt both at the family level, church level, society level and National level. This is as per the CMA motto: Good Family, Good Church, Good Society.<br><br>
    <strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong> <br>

<li>1). All Catholic Men above 18 years and not simultaneously members of the youth group. </li>
<li>2). All married Men who have been baptised.</li>
<li>3). Members of jumuiyas through small Christian Communities.</li>
<li>4). Associate membership – These are members of the clergy by the virtue of their ministry. </li>

<br>
<strong>OUR ACTIVITIES AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br>
Our activities and objectives include but not limited to:
<li>1. To bring together and unite Catholic men in Kenya.</li>
<li>2. To evangelize the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and defend the Catholic faith.</li>
<li>3. To promote the Catholic faith and religious life among members.</li>

</li>

<li>6. To promote healthy social behavior of members and care for environment.</li>
<li>7. To encourage and assist members to form socio-economic initiatives to promote self-
    reliance.</li><br>
<strong>HOW WE IMPACT FAITH AND CHRISTIAN LIVING IN THE PARISH</strong><br>
As a church based organization, we share many issues ranging from social, cultural, religious, spiritual, economic, environmental and development wise. Through interaction in these spectrums, we share ideas and teach each other to address these challenges some of which are personal. In some instances, we come together to assist needy members in times of adversity like

sickness, bereavement and economic needs. These activities reinforce the social ties that bind the members together thereby impacting positively among our members.
<br><br><strong>MEMBERSHIP RECRUITMENT AND COMMISSIONING</strong><br>
One can be a CMA member by registration but it’s through commissioning that an individual becomes a full member in the association. Members to be commissioned are required to be active in the church activities and be the members of the jumuiyas.
Recruitment is through announcements in the church and at Jumuiya level. Once a member accepts to join the CMA, he is required to pay membership fee (ranging from KES 100-300). This is followed with monthly subscription fro retention of the member (usually KES 200). Members are occasionally sensitized through seminars and retreats and participation in acts of mercy.
Commissioning classes and training are arranged for those who wish to be commissioned and eventually a commissioning day is arranged for all commissionees. Before commissioning, a member is expected to have a full CMA uniform, tie, badge and a white shirt.
<br><br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br>
CMA is an important organ and organization in the church and all men are encouraged to join since the benefits far outweigh the sacrifices one has to make in form of time, commitment and financial obligations. The spiritual benefits are uncountable.
