    <strong>y</strong>oung<strong>C</strong>atholic <strong>A</strong>dults (YCA) Is the last pastoral structure dedicated 
    to the youth in the Archdiocese,previously known as Young Adults Catholic Association(YACA).These are the youths who are
    aged from 27- 35yrs.It also includes those young people who are below 27 yrs but maried or with children.

    Y.C.A, unlike other youth groups, are rather independent because it is asumed that they are adults and capable of 
    self-management. However,they are under the guidance of the youth chaplain in the Archdiocese, deanery and parish level.
