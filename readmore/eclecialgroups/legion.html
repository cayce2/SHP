The Legion of Mary is an Association of Catholics who, with the sanction of the church and
under the powerful leadership of Mary Immaculate, Mediatrix of all Graces, have formed themselves into a legion for service 
in the warfare which is waged by the church against the world and its evil powers.<br><br>
It is organized on the model of the Roman army and adopts its terminology. It is at the disposal of the bishop diocese and 
the parish priest for any and every form of social service and catholic action which they deem suitable to the legionaries and 
useful for the warfare of the church.
The legionaries have a duty to show whole-hearted devotion to Mother Mary by serious meditation and Zealous practice. The 
Legionary service is a lifelong perseverance in the work of the apostolate. Legionaries knowing themselves to be soldiers are 
stimulated to impart a soldierly seriousness to their work.
