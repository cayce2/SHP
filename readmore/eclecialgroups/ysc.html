      The Parish Youth Serving Christ is a Catholic Youth group that brings together youth from the three different 
      outstations to evangelize and grow together in living their Christian lives. The purpose and direction of the group is 
      summarized in its motto; together we journey together we serve.<br><br>
      <strong>MEMBERSHIP</strong><br>
      The members of the Youth Serving Christ are the active and fully registered youth in all outstations. Membership is also
       open to unmarried youth between 18 and 27 years. To be fully registered, a youth has to present copies of the national
        identification card, baptismal card, letter from the respective Small Christian Community where they belong, two 
        passport-sized photos. <br><br>
        <strong>ACTIVITIES</strong><br>
      The main role of the Youth Serving Christ in the parish is liturgical; singing in the mass. Our activities are 
      categorized into two groups; spiritual and social. Spiritually, the group engages in recollections, group prayers, 
      weekly Bible sharing, spiritual talks as well as charity works. Socially, the Y.S.C engages in sporting tournaments and 
      cultural events dubbed ‘African Sunday’. We also have recreational activities such as hiking, sports, study tours and 
      other bonding activities.<br><br>

      <strong>FAITH AND CHRISTIAN LIVING</strong><br>
      The Youth Serving Christ impacts faith in its entire membership by having spiritual talks on a monthly basis and 
      having recollections often. In addition, the spiritual animators who journey with us are helpful in making faith-based 
      decisions regarding matters. By serving together, Christian living is impacted in the fact that we are able to make 
      social friendships that are based on our faith.<br>
