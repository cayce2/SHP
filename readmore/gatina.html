      <h3>History of St.Francis of Assisi - Gatina<h3>
Fr. Noel Took over the mantle. 
Fr. Noel had to seek assistance to help out with pastoral activities and it was Fr. Angelo, a Montfront Missionary who gave a helping hand in Gatina. This was the time when the new land was bought and semi-permanent church was erected in view of the permanent one. As Fr. Angelo had to leave for South America in 1994, an immediate replacement was done and a Pallottine, Fr. Sylvery Nkuu was sent to Sacred Heart Parish as an assistant. It was Fr. Sylvery in collaboaration with Christians and other well-wishers who took charge in making sure Gatina has the new and permanent church. A half an acre was bought and the project started on 15th August, 1995 and the church was inaugurated in 1997.
The record of the first sacraments to be administered in Gatina was in 1992: infant baptism were 60, 10 were confirmed, school age baptism were 33, catechumens who were baptized were 15 and 20 received the first holy communion. 
Due to the drastic increasing of population in Gatina and Kawangware area, the church decided to look and buy another land for the future church as an outstation. Under the guidance of Frs. Remi Mushy and John Makabe, fundraising started in …………… and that commenced March 2017. The new land is known as Bl. Elisabetta Saana area and it is the expectation of the church to start soon the construction of the future Blessed Elisabetta Saana church. 
The church has also a school project, St. Francis Catholic School. It started as a center to cater for the needs of the children of not well to do families. It was Fr. Angelo Maffin who initiated the project in 1993 which grew to accommodate more under the Franciscan Srs of the Sacred Heart (Srs. Karen and Maria).
The school structure was a one story building to 2017. Under the new school board of Mr. Jacob Lodi (chairperson), Lucy Gichuhi (treasurer) and Bridgid Mwema (member) together with the Church Parish Executive Council and the Fr. Msuri Emmanuel (In-Charge) a decision was reached to do the expansion of the school. The work began late November 2017 for the 2nd story using the school and the church funds. The project involved also building of toilets that will cater for the needs of the school and the church.  
It has approximately ten thousand (10,000) christians and has forty (40) Small Christian Communities (S.C.C). 

Currently the Church Pastoral Council (CPC) officials are as follows: 

        <li>Martin Kioko 	- CPC Moderator</li>
<li>Lucy Gichuhi 	- Vice CPC Moderator</li>
<li>Jeniffer Thuo 	- Secretary 	</li>

Francis had been born to wealthy parents in Assisi, Italy, in 1181. As a teenager, Francis wanted only money and fun. He loved parties! But in 1202, when he was 21, Francis went to war and spent a year in prison. There, he had time to think and pray.  In prison, Francis realized that money had not bought him happiness. But later, Francis went back to his old ways. Then he met a leper. Pus oozed from the leper’s sores. People turned away from him, but Francis walked right up and hugged him. He had seen God’s beauty in another human being. For Francis, life changed then and there.  In the years that followed, Francis gave away all his money. He preached and begged barefoot on the streets. A group of followers gathered around him, and he wrote a rule of life for them. They became the first Franciscans. He then founded the Order of Poor Clares, a religious order for women. He traveled to Spain and to Egypt to try to convert people there.  Francis asked his followers to praise God for the beauty of all creation. Everywhere he looked, Francis found God’s love. And so he called the earth his mother; the sun, his brother; the moon, his sister. They showed him God’s beauty. With all creatures of the earth, Francis shouted, “Praised be my Lord!”  And when he died at age 44 in 1226, people praised God for the beauty of Francis of Assisi. In 1228 he was proclaimed a saint.  When we see a manger scene at Christmas, it is said that we should thank St. Francis for this. Around the year 1220 he created a scene using real animals so that the local people could recall Jesus’ humble birth in a more realistic way.

He has this beautiful prayer which is a prayer for peace: … Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.  O, Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; it is in dying that we are born again to eternal life…
